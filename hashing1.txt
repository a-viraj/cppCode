# Hashing: Converting elements in smaller elements using some function(hash function).
# Collosion: If we get same key for two or more elements we use two method;
    1.  Seperate chaining
        If collision occour create a chain using linked list
    2.  Open addressing
        If collision occour use probing i.e. using a second argument called as prob number in hash function. Since it depends on key it is represented as P(k).
            i.  a*k + b;
            ii. a*k^2 + P*K +c;
            iii.k*h2, h(x) is the hasing function.
